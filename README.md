# Deadlock Detection
This is a deadlock detection web application using wait-for graph. This application lets you 
- create and move around vertices denoting processes
- draw directed edge between two edges denoting wait-for relation
- extract the adjacency matrix representation from the graph
- load a graph by providing the matrix representation.
- detect deadlock by edge chasing starting from a source vertex

## Controls

### Mobile 

- touch-leave-drag for drawing edges
- long press-drag for moving around vertices

### PC

- right click-drag for drawing edges
- left click-drag for moving around vertices

- double click/double tap edges to delete them
